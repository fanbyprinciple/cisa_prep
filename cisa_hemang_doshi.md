audit charter
    static changed annually
    outlines roles and responsibilities

compliance vs substantive testing
    attribute sampling vs variable sampling
    look for controls vs audit review
    select a subset of new items for complicance vs subjectively find item for testing
    attribute sampling internal controls
    last 50 new users tested - compliance testing

csa -control self assessment
    involving line managers
    finding high risk areas
    auditors are facilitators
    done during priliminary analysis
    early identification of risk

sampling
    stop or go sampling  - fast , not finding anything
    discovery sampling - discovering fraud
    confidence coefficient  - the probability that the sample is representative of the population 
        high sample size means high confidence coreraltion
    statistical sampling minimises detection risk, objective quatificaiton of data
    if interanlcontrolsare strong then reduce confidence coefficient
