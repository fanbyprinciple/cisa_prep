1. Use of preventive control
2. The synchronous copy of the storage achieves the RPO, and a warm site operational in 48 hours meets the required RTO. Asynchronous updates of the database in distributed locations do not meet the RPO. Synchronous updates of the data and standby active systems in a hot site meet the RPO and RTO requirements but are more costly than a warm site solution.
3. Understanding the business process is the first step an IS auditor needs to perform. ISACA IT audit and assurance standards encourage adoption of the audit procedures/processes required to assist the IS auditor in performing IS audits more effectively. However, standards do not require an IS auditor to perform a process walk-through at the commencement of an audit engagement. Identifying control weaknesses is not the primary reason for the walk-through and typically occurs at a later stage in the audit. Planning for substantive testing is performed at a later stage in the audit.
4. Paper test is doen after charting a plan
5. The first thing an IS auditor should do after detecting the virus is to alert the organization to its presence, then wait for their response. Choice A should be taken after choice C. This will enable an IS auditor to examine the actual workability and effectiveness of the response system. An IS auditor should not make changes to the system being audited, and ensuring the deletion of the virus is a management responsibility.
6. This choice directly addresses the problem. An organizationwide approach is needed to achieve effective management of data assets. This includes enforcing standard definitions of data elements, which is part of a data governance initiative. The other choices, while sound development practices, do not address the root cause of the problem described.
7. Choice B is correct since a critical web application requires continuous monitoring and maintenance that is normally performed by data center operations personnel, not by a development team. While system developers may be capable of performing computer operations tasks, they would not normally be on site 24/7 as would computer operations staff. Choice A is incorrect since the network traffic levels can be predicted and more bandwidth can be provisioned. Choices C and D are not correct because, while hosting a web server may create challenges to infrastructure and network security, the most critical issue would be the expertise and staffing required to monitor and maintain a critical web site.
8. 


A. While project management training is a good practice, it does not necessarily prevent scope creep without the use of a software baseline and a robust requirements change process.

B. Use of a software baseline provides a cutoff point for the design of the system and allows the project to proceed as scheduled without being delayed by scope creep.

C. A BSC is a coherent set of performance measures organized into four categories that includes traditional financial measures, but adds customer, internal business process, and learning and growth perspectives. It does not prevent scope creep.

D. Use of automated requirements software does not decrease the risk of scope creep.

9. The use of UTP in copper will reduce the likelihood of crosstalk. While the twisted nature of the media will reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic disturbances, an unshielded copper wire does not provide adequate protection against wiretapping. Attenuation sets in if copper twisted-pair cable is used for longer than 100 meters, necessitating the use of a repeater. The tools and techniques to install UTP are not simpler or easier than other copper-based cables.

10. Experience has demonstrated that reliance purely on preventative controls is dangerous. Preventative controls may not prove to be as strong as anticipated or their effectiveness can deteriorate over time. Evaluating the cost of controls versus the quantum of risk is a valid management concern. However, in a high-risk system a comprehensive control framework is needed. Intelligent design should permit additional detective and corrective controls to be established that don't have high ongoing costs, e.g., automated interrogation of logs to highlight suspicious individual transactions or data patterns. Effective access controls are, in themselves, a positive but, for reasons outlined above, may not sufficiently compensate for other control weaknesses. In this situation the IS auditor needs to be proactive. The IS auditor has a fundamental obligation to point out control weaknesses that give rise to unacceptable risk to the organization and work with management to have these corrected. Reviewing background checks on accounts payable staff does not provide evidence that fraud will not occur.

11. Major system migrations should include a phase of parallel operation or a phased cut-over to reduce implementation risk. Decommissioning or disposing of the old hardware would complicate any fallback strategy, should the new system not operate correctly. A weekend can be used as a time buffer so that the new system will have a better chance of being up and running after the weekend. A different data representation does not mean different data presentation at the front end. Even when this is the case, this issue can be solved by adequate training and user support. The printing functionality is commonly one of the last functions to be tested in a new system because it is usually the last step performed in any business event. Thus, meaningful testing and the respective error fixing are only possible after all other parts of the software have been successfully tested.

12. 
A. The programming language may be a concern if it is not a commonly used language; however, program coding standards are more important.

B. The development environment may be relevant to evaluate the efficiency of the program development process, but not future maintenance of the program.

C. A version control system helps manage software code revisions; however, it does not ensure that coding standards are consistently applied.

D. Program coding standards are required for efficient program maintenance and modifications. To enhance the quality of programming activities and future maintenance capabilities, program coding standards should be applied. Program coding standards are essential to writing, reading and understanding code, simply and clearly, without having to refer back to design specifications.

13. 
An IDS cannot detect attacks within encrypted traffic, and it would be a concern if someone were misinformed and thought that the IDS could detect attacks in encrypted traffic. An organization can place sensors outside of the firewall to detect attacks. These sensors are placed in highly sensitive areas and on extranets. Causing many false alarms is normal for a behavior-based IDS, and should not be a matter of concern. Being weak against new types of attacks is also expected from a signature-based IDS, because it can only recognize attacks that have been previously identified.

14. 
A. Ensuring that the project meets the intended business requirements is the primary objective of a postimplementation review.

B. Evaluating the adequacy of controls may be part of the review, but is not the primary objective.

C. Confirming compliance with technological standards is normally not part of the postimplementation review because this should be addressed during the design and development phase.

D. Confirming compliance with regulatory requirements is normally not part of the postimplementation review because this should be addressed during the design and development phase.

15. 

Succession planning ensures that internal personnel with the potential to fill key positions in the company are identified and developed. Job evaluation is the process of determining the worth of one job in relation to that of the other jobs in a company so that a fair and equitable wage and salary system can be established. Staff responsibilities definition provides for well-defined roles and responsibilities, and employee award programs provide motivation; however, they do not minimize dependency on key individuals.

16. 
DSS emphasizes flexibility in the decision making approach of users. It is aimed at solving less structured problems, combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions, and supports semistructured decision making tasks.

17. 
To ensure the organization's survival following a disaster, it is important to recover the most critical business processes first. It is a common mistake to overemphasize value (A) rather than urgency. For example, while the processing of incoming mortgage loan payments is important from a financial perspective, it could be delayed for a few days in the event of a disaster. On the other hand, wiring funds to close on a loan, while not generating direct revenue, is far more critical because of the possibility of regulatory problems, customer complaints and reputation issues. Choices B and D are not correct because neither the long-term business strategy nor the mere number of recovered systems has a direct impact at this point in time.

18. 
Parallel testing is the best method for testing data results and system behavior because it allows the users to compare obtained results with both systems before decommission of the legacy system. Parallel testing also results in better user adoption of the new system. Multiple testing will not compare results from the old and new systems. Integration testing refers to how the system interacts with other systems, and it is not performed by end users. Prototype testing will not compare results from the old and new systems.

Open hubs represent a significant control weakness because of the potential to access a network connection easily. An intelligent hub would allow the deactivation of a single port while leaving the remaining ports active. Additionally, physical security would also provide reasonable protection over hubs with active ports.

2. 
Depending on the complexity of an organization, there could be more than one plan to address various aspects of business continuity and disaster recovery. These do not necessarily have to be integrated into one single plan. However, each plan has to be consistent with other plans to have a viable business continuity planning strategy. It may not be possible to define a sequence in which plans have to be implemented, as it may be dependent on the nature of disaster, criticality, recovery time, etc.

3. 
The password should be changed immediately since there is no way to know whether it has been compromised. While the IS audit department should be notified, this should not be the first action. Changing the DBA account name could impact production database servers and thus would not be a good idea. Similarly, suspending the DBA account could impact the production database servers.

5. 
RPO defines the point in time to which data must be restored after a disaster so as to resume processing transactions. Backups should be performed in a way that the latest backup is no older than this maximum time frame. If service levels are not met, the usual consequences are penalty payments, not cessation of business. Organizations will try to set SLOs so as to meet established targets. The resulting time for the service level agreement (SLA) will usually be longer than the RPO. RTO defines the time period after the disaster in which normal business functionality needs to be restored. MAO is the maximum amount of system downtime that is tolerable. It can be used as a synonym for RTO. However, the RTO denotes an objective/target, while the MAO constitutes a vital necessity for an organization's survival.

6. 
The first step is to understand the importance and role of the network device within the organization's network topology. After understanding the devices in the network, the best practice for using the device should be reviewed to ensure that there are no anomalies within the configuration. Identification of which component or subcomponent is missing or being used inappropriately can only be known upon reviewing and understanding the topology and the best practice for deployment of the device in the network.

7. 
End-user computing is defined as the ability of end users to design and implement their own information system utilizing computer software products. End-user developed applications may not be subjected to an independent outside review by systems analysts and frequently are not created in the context of a formal development methodology. These applications may lack appropriate standards, controls, quality assurance procedures, and documentation. A risk of end-user applications is that management may rely on them as much as traditional applications. EUC systems typically result in reduced application development and maintenance costs, and a reduced development cycle time. EUC systems normally increase flexibility and responsiveness to management's information requests.

8. 
When an IS auditor uses a source code comparison to examine source program changes without information from IS personnel, the IS auditor has an objective, independent and relatively complete assurance of program changes because the source code comparison will identify the changes. Choice B is incorrect, because the changes made since the acquisition of the copy are not included in the copy of the software. Choice C is incorrect, as an IS auditor will have to gain this assurance separately. Choice D is incorrect, because any changes made between the time the control copy was acquired and the source code comparison is made will not be detected.

Since management is aware that the project had problems, reviewing the subsequent fixes will provide insight into the types and potential causes of the project issues. This will help to identify whether IT has adequately planned for those issues in the subsequent phases. While all choices are valid, the postimplementation focus and primary objective should be assuring that the issues of the initial phase are addressed.

12. 
Deleting and formatting does not completely erase the data but only marks the sectors that contained files as being free. There are tools available over the Internet which allow one to reconstruct most of a hard disk's contents. Overwriting a hard disk at the sector level would completely erase data, directories, indices and master file tables. Reformatting is not necessary since all contents are destroyed. Overwriting several times makes useless some forensic measures which are able to reconstruct former contents of newly overwritten sectors by analyzing special magnetic features of the platter's surface. While hole-punching does not delete file contents, the hard disk cannot be used anymore, especially when head parking zones and track zero information are impacted. Reconstructing data would be extremely expensive since all analysis must be performed under a clean room atmosphere and is only possible within a short time frame or until the surface is corroded. Data reconstruction from shredded hard disks is virtually impossible, especially when the scrap is mixed with other metal parts. If the transport can be secured and the destruction be proved as described in the option, this is a valid method of disposal.

If the auditee disagrees with the impact of a finding, it is important for an IS auditor to elaborate and clarify the risk and exposures, as the auditee may not fully appreciate the magnitude of the exposure. The goal should be to enlighten the auditee or uncover new information of which an IS auditor may not have been aware. Anything that appears to threaten the auditee will lessen effective communications and set up an adversarial relationship. By the same token, an IS auditor should not automatically agree just because the auditee expresses an alternate point of view.

3. Sensitive functions are best described as those that can be performed manually at a tolerable cost for an extended period of time. Critical functions are those that cannot be performed unless they are replaced by identical capabilities and cannot be replaced by manual methods. Vital functions refer to those that can be performed manually but only for a brief period of time; this is associated with lower costs of disruption than critical functions. Noncritical functions may be interrupted for an extended period of time at little or no cost to the company, and require little time or cost to restore.

Its always firewall
In this case, a firewall could be used as a strong control to allow authorized users on the wireless network to access the wired network. While having two physically separate networks would ensure the security of customer data, it would make it impossible for authorized wireless users to access that data. While a VLAN would provide separation of the two networks, it is possible, with sufficient knowledge, for an attacker to gain access to one VLAN from the other. Similarly, a dedicated router between the two networks would separate them; however, this would be less secure than a firewall.

5. 
project portfolio
A project portfolio database is the basis for project portfolio management. It includes project data, such as owner, schedules, objectives, project type, status and cost. Project portfolio management requires specific project portfolio reports. A project database may contain the above for one specific project and updates to various parameters pertaining to the current status of that single project. Policy documents on project management set direction for the design, development, implementation and monitoring of the project. Program organization is the team required (steering committee, quality assurance, systems personnel, analyst, programmer, hardware support, etc.) to meet the delivery objective of the project.

1. 
If developers have access to the production environment, there is a risk that untested code can be migrated into the production environment. In situations in which there is no dedicated testing group, the business analyst is often the one to perform testing because the analyst has detailed knowledge of how the system must function as a result of writing the requirements. It is acceptable in a small team for the IT manager to perform system administration, as long as the manager does not also develop code. Choice D is not correct because it may be part of the DBA's duties to perform backups.

2. 
A reciprocal agreement in which two organizations agree to provide computing resources to each other in the event of a disaster is a form of risk mitigation. This usually works well if both organizations have similar information processing facilities. Because the intended effect of reciprocal agreements is to have a functional DRP, it is a risk mitigation strategy. Risk transfer is the transference of risk to a third party, e.g., buying insurance for activities that pose a risk. Risk avoidance is the decision to cease operations or activities that give rise to a risk. For example, a company may stop accepting credit card payments to avoid the risk of credit card information disclosure. When an organization decides to accept the risk as is and do nothing to mitigate or transfer it, that is risk acceptance.

3. 
While an IS audit may identify instances of inappropriate access, it is the business owner who would identify that issue first. Presence of an identity management application is not a prerequisite for carrying out a review of the access list. Account reconciliations assess the validity, correctness or appropriateness of the account balance at a specific point in time, but do not review user access privileges.

1. The three primary dimensions of a project are determined by the deliverables, the allocated resources and the delivery time. The area of the project management triangle, comprised of these three dimensions, is fixed. Depending on the degree of freedom, changes in one dimension might be compensated by changing either one or both remaining dimensions. Thus, if resource allocation is decreased an increase in quality can be achieved, if a delay in the delivery time of the project will be accepted. The area of the triangle always remains constant.

The long-term financial viability of a vendor is essential for deriving maximum value for the organization—it is more likely that a financially sound vendor would be in business for a long period of time. The capability of the organization to support the enterprise should extend beyond the time of execution of the contract. The objective of financial evaluation should not be confined to the immediate contract, but to provide assurance over a longer time frame. The specific financial condition of the vendor would not be of primary concern.

2. 
Portfolio management is designed to assist in the definition, prioritization, approval and running of a set of projects within a given organization. These tools offer data capture, workflow and scenario planning functionality, which can help identify the optimum set of projects (from the full set of ideas) to take forward within a given budget. A CMM would not help determine the optimum portfolio of capital projects since it is a means of assessing the relative maturity of the IT processes within an organization: running from Level 0 (Incomplete—Processes are not implemented or fail to achieve their purpose) to Level 5 (Optimizing—Metrics are defined and measured, and continuous improvement techniques are in place). A configuration management database (which stores the configuration details for an organization's IT systems) is an important tool for IT service delivery and, in particular, change management. It may provide information that would influence the prioritization of projects, but is not designed for that purpose. PMBOK is a methodology for the management and delivery of projects. It offers no specific guidance or assistance in optimizing a project portfolio.

A. The RPO is determined based on the acceptable data loss in case of a disruption of operations. It indicates the earliest point in time that is acceptable to recover the data. The RPO effectively quantifies the permissible amount of data loss in case of interruption. The media creation date will reflect the point to which data are to be restored or the RPO.

B. The RTO is the amount of time allowed for the recovery of a business function or resource after a disaster occurs.

C. The SDO is directly related to the business needs, and is the level of service to be reached during the alternate process mode until the normal situation is restored.

D. The MTO is the maximum time that an organization can support processing in alternate mode.

Applying a cryptographic hashing algorithm against the entire message addresses the message integrity issue. Enciphering the message digest using the sender's private key addresses nonrepudiation. Encrypting the message with a symmetric key, thereafter allowing the key to be enciphered using the receiver's public key, most efficiently addresses the confidentiality of the message as well as the receiver's nonrepudiation. The other choices would address only a portion of the requirements.

A paper test is appropriate for testing a BCP. It is a walk-through of the entire plan, or part of the plan, involving major players in the plan's execution, who reason out what may happen in a particular disaster. Choices A, C and D are not appropriate for a BCP.

3. 
It is critical for the EA to include the future state because the gap between the current state and the future state will determine IT strategic and tactical plans. If the EA does not include a future-state representation, it is not complete, and this issue should be reported as a finding. Choice A is not correct because the IS auditor would not ordinarily provide input on the timing of projects, but rather provide an assessment of the current environment. The most critical issue in this scenario is that the EA is not yet complete, so the auditor should be most concerned with reporting this issue. Choice C is not correct because the company is free to choose any EA framework and the IS auditor should not recommend a specific framework. Choice D is not correct because changing the scope of an audit to include the secondary project is not a realistic option.

An IS auditor must review the change management process, including patch management procedures, and verify that the process has adequate controls and make suggestions accordingly. The other choices are part of a good change management process but are not an IS auditor's responsibility.

2. 
Although maintenance requirements vary based on complexity and performance workloads, a hardware maintenance schedule should be validated against the vendor-provided specifications. For business reasons, an organization may choose a more aggressive maintenance program than the vendor's program. The maintenance program should include maintenance performance history, be it planned, unplanned, executed or exceptional. Unplanned maintenance cannot be scheduled. Hardware maintenance programs do not necessarily need to be in line with historical trends. Maintenance schedules normally are not approved by the steering committee.

3. 
The use of a DBA user account is normally set up to log all changes made and is most appropriate for changes made outside of normal working hours. The use of a log allows changes to be reviewed. The privileged accounts can be used by multiple users, and the use of a normal user account with no restrictions would allow uncontrolled changes to the databases. The use of the DBA user account without logging would permit uncontrolled changes to be made to databases once access to the account was obtained.

4. 
RTO measures an organization's tolerance for downtime and RPO measures how much data loss can be accepted. Choices B, C and D are incorrect since they exceed the RTO limits set by the scenario.

Mapping identifies specific program logic that has not been tested and analyzes programs during execution to indicate whether program statements have been executed. A snapshot records the flow of designated transactions through logic paths within programs. Tracing and tagging shows the trail of instructions executed during an application. Logging is the activity of recording specific tasks for future review.

6. 
It is a common mistake to use scenario planning for business continuity. The problem is that it is impossible to plan and document actions for every possible scenario. Planning for just selected scenarios denies the fact that even improbable events can cause an organization to break down. Best practice planning addresses the four possible areas of impact in a disaster: premises, people, systems and suppliers and other dependencies. All scenarios can be reduced to these four categories and can be handled simultaneously. There are very few special scenarios which justify an additional separate analysis. It is a good idea to use best practices and external advice for such an important topic, especially since knowledge of the right level of preparedness and the judgment about adequacy of the measures taken is not available in every organization. The RTOs are based on the essential business processes required to ensure the organization's survival; therefore, it would be inappropriate for them to be based on IT capabilities. Best practice guidelines recommend having 20–40 percent of normal capacity available at an emergency site; therefore, a value of 50 percent would not be a problem if there are no additional factors.
