1. Use of preventive control
2. The synchronous copy of the storage achieves the RPO, and a warm site operational in 48 hours meets the required RTO. Asynchronous updates of the database in distributed locations do not meet the RPO. Synchronous updates of the data and standby active systems in a hot site meet the RPO and RTO requirements but are more costly than a warm site solution.
3. Understanding the business process is the first step an IS auditor needs to perform. ISACA IT audit and assurance standards encourage adoption of the audit procedures/processes required to assist the IS auditor in performing IS audits more effectively. However, standards do not require an IS auditor to perform a process walk-through at the commencement of an audit engagement. Identifying control weaknesses is not the primary reason for the walk-through and typically occurs at a later stage in the audit. Planning for substantive testing is performed at a later stage in the audit.
4. Paper test is doen after charting a plan
5. The first thing an IS auditor should do after detecting the virus is to alert the organization to its presence, then wait for their response. Choice A should be taken after choice C. This will enable an IS auditor to examine the actual workability and effectiveness of the response system. An IS auditor should not make changes to the system being audited, and ensuring the deletion of the virus is a management responsibility.
6. This choice directly addresses the problem. An organizationwide approach is needed to achieve effective management of data assets. This includes enforcing standard definitions of data elements, which is part of a data governance initiative. The other choices, while sound development practices, do not address the root cause of the problem described.
7. Choice B is correct since a critical web application requires continuous monitoring and maintenance that is normally performed by data center operations personnel, not by a development team. While system developers may be capable of performing computer operations tasks, they would not normally be on site 24/7 as would computer operations staff. Choice A is incorrect since the network traffic levels can be predicted and more bandwidth can be provisioned. Choices C and D are not correct because, while hosting a web server may create challenges to infrastructure and network security, the most critical issue would be the expertise and staffing required to monitor and maintain a critical web site.

A. While project management training is a good practice, it does not necessarily prevent scope creep without the use of a software baseline and a robust requirements change process.

B. Use of a software baseline provides a cutoff point for the design of the system and allows the project to proceed as scheduled without being delayed by scope creep.

C. A BSC is a coherent set of performance measures organized into four categories that includes traditional financial measures, but adds customer, internal business process, and learning and growth perspectives. It does not prevent scope creep.

D. Use of automated requirements software does not decrease the risk of scope creep.

9. The use of UTP in copper will reduce the likelihood of crosstalk. While the twisted nature of the media will reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic disturbances, an unshielded copper wire does not provide adequate protection against wiretapping. Attenuation sets in if copper twisted-pair cable is used for longer than 100 meters, necessitating the use of a repeater. The tools and techniques to install UTP are not simpler or easier than other copper-based cables.

10. Experience has demonstrated that reliance purely on preventative controls is dangerous. Preventative controls may not prove to be as strong as anticipated or their effectiveness can deteriorate over time. Evaluating the cost of controls versus the quantum of risk is a valid management concern. However, in a high-risk system a comprehensive control framework is needed. Intelligent design should permit additional detective and corrective controls to be established that don't have high ongoing costs, e.g., automated interrogation of logs to highlight suspicious individual transactions or data patterns. Effective access controls are, in themselves, a positive but, for reasons outlined above, may not sufficiently compensate for other control weaknesses. In this situation the IS auditor needs to be proactive. The IS auditor has a fundamental obligation to point out control weaknesses that give rise to unacceptable risk to the organization and work with management to have these corrected. Reviewing background checks on accounts payable staff does not provide evidence that fraud will not occur.

11. Major system migrations should include a phase of parallel operation or a phased cut-over to reduce implementation risk. Decommissioning or disposing of the old hardware would complicate any fallback strategy, should the new system not operate correctly. A weekend can be used as a time buffer so that the new system will have a better chance of being up and running after the weekend. A different data representation does not mean different data presentation at the front end. Even when this is the case, this issue can be solved by adequate training and user support. The printing functionality is commonly one of the last functions to be tested in a new system because it is usually the last step performed in any business event. Thus, meaningful testing and the respective error fixing are only possible after all other parts of the software have been successfully tested.

A. The programming language may be a concern if it is not a commonly used language; however, program coding standards are more important.

B. The development environment may be relevant to evaluate the efficiency of the program development process, but not future maintenance of the program.

C. A version control system helps manage software code revisions; however, it does not ensure that coding standards are consistently applied.

D. Program coding standards are required for efficient program maintenance and modifications. To enhance the quality of programming activities and future maintenance capabilities, program coding standards should be applied. Program coding standards are essential to writing, reading and understanding code, simply and clearly, without having to refer back to design specifications.

13. 
An IDS cannot detect attacks within encrypted traffic, and it would be a concern if someone were misinformed and thought that the IDS could detect attacks in encrypted traffic. An organization can place sensors outside of the firewall to detect attacks. These sensors are placed in highly sensitive areas and on extranets. Causing many false alarms is normal for a behavior-based IDS, and should not be a matter of concern. Being weak against new types of attacks is also expected from a signature-based IDS, because it can only recognize attacks that have been previously identified.

14. 
A. Ensuring that the project meets the intended business requirements is the primary objective of a postimplementation review.

B. Evaluating the adequacy of controls may be part of the review, but is not the primary objective.

C. Confirming compliance with technological standards is normally not part of the postimplementation review because this should be addressed during the design and development phase.

D. Confirming compliance with regulatory requirements is normally not part of the postimplementation review because this should be addressed during the design and development phase.

Succession planning ensures that internal personnel with the potential to fill key positions in the company are identified and developed. Job evaluation is the process of determining the worth of one job in relation to that of the other jobs in a company so that a fair and equitable wage and salary system can be established. Staff responsibilities definition provides for well-defined roles and responsibilities, and employee award programs provide motivation; however, they do not minimize dependency on key individuals.

DSS emphasizes flexibility in the decision making approach of users. It is aimed at solving less structured problems, combines the use of models and analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions, and supports semistructured decision making tasks.

17. 
To ensure the organization's survival following a disaster, it is important to recover the most critical business processes first. It is a common mistake to overemphasize value (A) rather than urgency. For example, while the processing of incoming mortgage loan payments is important from a financial perspective, it could be delayed for a few days in the event of a disaster. On the other hand, wiring funds to close on a loan, while not generating direct revenue, is far more critical because of the possibility of regulatory problems, customer complaints and reputation issues. Choices B and D are not correct because neither the long-term business strategy nor the mere number of recovered systems has a direct impact at this point in time.

18. 
Parallel testing is the best method for testing data results and system behavior because it allows the users to compare obtained results with both systems before decommission of the legacy system. Parallel testing also results in better user adoption of the new system. Multiple testing will not compare results from the old and new systems. Integration testing refers to how the system interacts with other systems, and it is not performed by end users. Prototype testing will not compare results from the old and new systems.

Open hubs represent a significant control weakness because of the potential to access a network connection easily. An intelligent hub would allow the deactivation of a single port while leaving the remaining ports active. Additionally, physical security would also provide reasonable protection over hubs with active ports.

2. 
Depending on the complexity of an organization, there could be more than one plan to address various aspects of business continuity and disaster recovery. These do not necessarily have to be integrated into one single plan. However, each plan has to be consistent with other plans to have a viable business continuity planning strategy. It may not be possible to define a sequence in which plans have to be implemented, as it may be dependent on the nature of disaster, criticality, recovery time, etc.

3. 
The password should be changed immediately since there is no way to know whether it has been compromised. While the IS audit department should be notified, this should not be the first action. Changing the DBA account name could impact production database servers and thus would not be a good idea. Similarly, suspending the DBA account could impact the production database servers.

RPO defines the point in time to which data must be restored after a disaster so as to resume processing transactions. Backups should be performed in a way that the latest backup is no older than this maximum time frame. If service levels are not met, the usual consequences are penalty payments, not cessation of business. Organizations will try to set SLOs so as to meet established targets. The resulting time for the service level agreement (SLA) will usually be longer than the RPO. RTO defines the time period after the disaster in which normal business functionality needs to be restored. MAO is the maximum amount of system downtime that is tolerable. It can be used as a synonym for RTO. However, the RTO denotes an objective/target, while the MAO constitutes a vital necessity for an organization's survival.

6. 
The first step is to understand the importance and role of the network device within the organization's network topology. After understanding the devices in the network, the best practice for using the device should be reviewed to ensure that there are no anomalies within the configuration. Identification of which component or subcomponent is missing or being used inappropriately can only be known upon reviewing and understanding the topology and the best practice for deployment of the device in the network.

7. 
End-user computing is defined as the ability of end users to design and implement their own information system utilizing computer software products. End-user developed applications may not be subjected to an independent outside review by systems analysts and frequently are not created in the context of a formal development methodology. These applications may lack appropriate standards, controls, quality assurance procedures, and documentation. A risk of end-user applications is that management may rely on them as much as traditional applications. EUC systems typically result in reduced application development and maintenance costs, and a reduced development cycle time. EUC systems normally increase flexibility and responsiveness to management's information requests.

8. 
When an IS auditor uses a source code comparison to examine source program changes without information from IS personnel, the IS auditor has an objective, independent and relatively complete assurance of program changes because the source code comparison will identify the changes. Choice B is incorrect, because the changes made since the acquisition of the copy are not included in the copy of the software. Choice C is incorrect, as an IS auditor will have to gain this assurance separately. Choice D is incorrect, because any changes made between the time the control copy was acquired and the source code comparison is made will not be detected.

Since management is aware that the project had problems, reviewing the subsequent fixes will provide insight into the types and potential causes of the project issues. This will help to identify whether IT has adequately planned for those issues in the subsequent phases. While all choices are valid, the postimplementation focus and primary objective should be assuring that the issues of the initial phase are addressed.

Deleting and formatting does not completely erase the data but only marks the sectors that contained files as being free. There are tools available over the Internet which allow one to reconstruct most of a hard disk's contents. Overwriting a hard disk at the sector level would completely erase data, directories, indices and master file tables. Reformatting is not necessary since all contents are destroyed. Overwriting several times makes useless some forensic measures which are able to reconstruct former contents of newly overwritten sectors by analyzing special magnetic features of the platter's surface. While hole-punching does not delete file contents, the hard disk cannot be used anymore, especially when head parking zones and track zero information are impacted. Reconstructing data would be extremely expensive since all analysis must be performed under a clean room atmosphere and is only possible within a short time frame or until the surface is corroded. Data reconstruction from shredded hard disks is virtually impossible, especially when the scrap is mixed with other metal parts. If the transport can be secured and the destruction be proved as described in the option, this is a valid method of disposal.

If the auditee disagrees with the impact of a finding, it is important for an IS auditor to elaborate and clarify the risk and exposures, as the auditee may not fully appreciate the magnitude of the exposure. The goal should be to enlighten the auditee or uncover new information of which an IS auditor may not have been aware. Anything that appears to threaten the auditee will lessen effective communications and set up an adversarial relationship. By the same token, an IS auditor should not automatically agree just because the auditee expresses an alternate point of view.

An organization would have reached the highest level of the software CMM at level 5, optimizing. Quantitative quality goals can be reached at level 4 and below, a documented process is executed at level 3 and below, and a process tailored to specific projects can be achieved at level 2 or below.
